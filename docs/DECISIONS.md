# DECISIONS.md — running changelog

Per-topic ADRs live in `docs/adr/`. This file is the chronological record.

## 2026-07-07 (overnight web-first sprint)

- **Web-first pivot.** First deliverable is a deployed static site (GitHub Pages), not the iOS app — App Store distribution wasn't feasible for a next-morning test. The site front-loads the M2 curation-quality gate ("would I pick something from this menu?"); the iOS roadmap in `docs/brief/06_ROADMAP.md` is unchanged, just re-sequenced. Audio-session choreography (M0's top risk) is untestable on web and remains the first iOS task.
- **Playback = external handoff.** Cards link out: Apple Podcasts (episode-level deep links), Overcast (show-level — Overcast has no public episode-URL scheme), pod.link (show-level universal links; covers Android testers). No hosted or proxied audio, consistent with hard constraint #3.
- **Repo is public** on GitHub (free Pages requires it). No secrets in repo; `.env` is gitignored with `.env.example` template committed.
- **Pages deploys from `main` branch root** (legacy build + `.nojekyll`), not GitHub Actions — the gh OAuth token lacks `workflow` scope. Revisit if/when `gh auth refresh -s workflow` is run.
- **Taxonomy anchors to Apple Podcasts categories** (the industry-standard taxonomy used by Podcast Index) with custom two-level nodes beneath, because Apple's tree has no Engineering category and no History/Science subtypes that match the user's interests. Depth (low/medium/high) is a **per-episode attribute**, not a taxonomy dimension. See `docs/research/curation-practices.md` and ADR-0003.
- **Session document v1** (`data/session.json`): cards with archetype/why_line/fit_line/alternates + an episodes map + browsable categories. The web client and the future iOS client consume the same document. `data/validated-links.json` is a generated overlay (resolved track IDs, artwork) so hand-curated data and machine-verified data stay separable.
- **Curation for session 1 was done by the architect (Claude) at build time**, from agent-researched candidates verified against the iTunes API. The backend session builder (in progress) reproduces this pipeline programmatically.
- **Commute parameters**: 15–20 min drive, playback at 1.5× → ~27 content-minutes per commute. Fit-lines speak in the user's effective listening time.
- **Long episodes are offered honestly** (e.g., the 3¼-hour Whyte episode is the Deep-learn lead with a "week of drives" fit-line) per the resume-across-sessions model — not filtered out.
- **Client-side event logging** (`localStorage`, capped at 500 events): session_shown / picked / refreshed. This is the learning-signal schema seed; syncs to the backend `events` table once it exists.
- **Podcast Index key is pending** (their signup email is slow) — everything tonight uses the keyless iTunes Search/Lookup API; the backend's Podcast Index client ships in dry-run mode.

## 2026-07-08 (first-morning feedback)

- **Discovery must feel like a splatter, not a directory.** Static category shelves replaced with a shuffled cross-topic feed: interest-weighted sampling with heavy jitter, a hard 30% exploration floor ("wildcards" that ignore weights), and no two adjacent items from the same topic branch. Taxonomy remains internal machinery + an editable interests panel, never the primary browse UI.
- **State is observed, never declared.** User principle: playback position, episode-finished status, and listening-stint length must be inferred by the system, not entered by the user. The iOS architecture already complies (15-second position persistence + events table drive the Continue card automatically). The web page's "Done ✓" button is a documented stopgap — external podcast apps hide playback position from us — and disappears when playback moves in-app.
- **Commute length is demoted from setting to learned parameter.** Dropped from all UI copy (no more "fits your drive" fit-lines; duration shown plainly). The user is happy spanning an episode across several drives. Session assembly's target duration should eventually be inferred from session start/stop events; retained internally only as a heuristic default (e.g. the web Continue-card threshold).
- **Fresh on every load.** Card slots shuffle their candidate chains per visit (already-played sink to the back); splatter excludes the ~36 most recently shown items. Stars/saves persist snapshots locally and gently boost topic weights (spec: "saved = right content, wrong time").

## 2026-07-08 (night 2: rename, marketing synthesis, hardening)

- **Renamed CommutePilot → Foray** per the naming study (foray.fm RDAP-available, App Store clear). Repo is now `wjduvall-cmd/foray`; marketing docs keep the old name as historical record; localStorage keys unchanged.
- **Marketing program concluded** (docs/marketing/00–08): market brief + requirements delta synthesized from four research desks, a legal memo, and a red-team pre-mortem. Product principles trumped three proven-but-conflicting tactics (familiarity-heavy menus, streaks, clip feeds). **Standing order adopted from the pre-mortem: marketing corpus and web-client features are frozen; next effort goes to the automated builder's menu quality (blind machine-vs-hand test, R1) and the iOS audio spike (14-day timebox, R5).**
- **Quality/security gates shipped:** CI (backend tests + data validation), copy-rules test suite gating all user-facing copy, XSS hardening (esc + safeUrl + strict CSP), secrets/history scan clean, CLAUDE.md agent guide, `builder` field + 5000-event buffer for the blind-test and retention telemetry.

## 2026-07-09 (night 3: the go-ham run)

- **Catalog engine ran three waves: 154 shows / 389 episodes across ~35 topic branches**, every entry iTunes-verified, every hook copy-gated, every episode tagged (5–10 tags), all durable data per docs/DURABLE-WORK.md. Client payload ceiling checked: largest fetch ~300KB vs ~1.5MB soft cap.
- **Semantic search layer complete: 112 concept clusters + 28 modifiers + 389/389 tagged.** The "lightweight model" is compiled offline by a frontier model into data/semantic-index.json + item-tags.json; the client interprets asks (concept expansion, duration/branch/recency filters, progressive relaxation). Same index becomes the server-side query-rewrite layer later.
- **Architecture assessment (docs/architecture-assessment.md, 27 actions)** — four defects fixed same-night: builder field missing from backend session output (would have silently invalidated the R1 blind test), 3 episodes duplicated across ID schemes, 11 topic branches missing taxonomy nodes (stars/sliders silently no-oped), backend fitLine still generating banned commute copy. New CI invariants enforce all of it. Profile IDs + data export shipped for tester identity.
- **ForayKit Swift suite executed for the first time** (new macos-latest CI job): one manifest fix (tools-6-only API), then all tests green. iOS code is now under permanent compile+test protection.
- **Marketing review 2 (docs/marketing/09)**: R13–R23; iOS v1 table-stakes fixed at six player features; offline shell shipped same-night (service worker; the web app previously white-screened offline). Watchlist: Spotify Prompted Playlists + Snipd AI DJ assessed — R10 triggers NOT fired.
- **Standing order retained:** with the catalog engine done, the two life-or-death items remain the R1 blind test (waiting on the Anthropic key) and the iOS audio spike (waiting on the Mac).

## 2026-07-09 (scale day)

- **Search ranking overhauled** after "sleep training" surfaced AI content: coverage tiers, contextual concept disambiguation, word-boundary matching for short tokens, document-frequency term weighting. Verified on the failing query + controls.
- **Two-tier catalog architecture adopted** (docs/CATALOG-PIPELINE.md): curated tier (editorial waves, episode-level) + breadth tier (programmatic). **19,787 shows harvested** across all 110 Apple podcast genres via checkpoint-resumable tools/harvest-catalog.mjs — 99.7% with feed URLs, chart-rank popularity priors, Podcast Index cross-ref fields reserved. Backend seed data; not client-fetched.
- **Multi-app identity captured** (data/app-links.json): Pocket Casts + Castbox verified derivable from Apple IDs; Overcast scheme standard but not server-verifiable; 38 native Spotify IDs search-verified for top curated shows (pod.link unscrapable — SPA behind checkpoint); YouTube Music deferred. Feed URL remains the master key.
- **Breadth tier fully classified**: 19,787 shows with taxonomy topics (genre-map base + 8-slice opus refinement, per-entry provenance), 516 curated episodes at series depth. The curation engine now has a mapped universe with popularity priors.
- **Branch-out complete (2026-07-09)**: market-share audit (docs/marketing/10) drove five gap-curation waves — comedy at depth, true crime/paranormal, wellness/psychology/parenting, storytelling/relationships, kids/fiction/arts. Curated tier: 213 shows / 679 episodes, episode-level coverage of US listening hours ~12%→~75%. News/sports deferred until feed polling exists (timely content expires). Per-episode explicit flags from contentAdvisoryRating (show-level flags proven unreliable) — family-mode data prerequisite met. Episode archive: 73,719 episodes for the top-100 shows (full public feeds).
