//
// Thin protocol wrapping the handful of AVPlayer operations
// PlayerQueueManager needs. This exists purely so PlayerQueueManager's
// orchestration logic (which effect -> which backend call, in what order)
// can be exercised in tests with a fake/mock backend, without touching
// AVFoundation or a real audio session. The actual state-machine logic this
// wraps around lives in ForayKit and is already fully unit tested
// without AVFoundation; this protocol boundary is for testing the *glue*.
//
// Deliberately synchronous/void where AVPlayer itself is synchronous
// (`play()`, `pause()`, `rate =`), and `async throws` only where loading an
// asset genuinely involves asynchronous work (`load(url:)`).

// directly. Confirm on real hardware that AVPlayer's own internal callbacks
// (KVO, notification delivery) that we bridge via `onItemDidPlayToEnd`
// don't reenter this instance from a background thread in a way that races
// with actor-issued calls.
