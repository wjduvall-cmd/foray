// MARK: - PlayerQueueState
//
// Formal state machine for Foray's player queue, per
// docs/brief/04_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC.md ("Custom PlayerQueueManager over
// AVPlayer... Formal state machine: idle -> loadingItem -> playing ->
// transitioning -> interrupted -> ended, with unit tests for every edge").
//
// This file has ZERO dependency on AVFoundation. `reduce(state:event:)` is a
// pure function: (state, event) -> (newState, [effects]). The *caller*
// (PlayerQueueManager, in the App target) is responsible for interpreting
// PlayerEffect values against a real AVPlayer/AVAudioSession. That split is
// what makes every corner case in docs/brief/05_CORNER_CASES.md #11-19
// testable without a simulator.
//
// Design decisions worth calling out (not AVFoundation-uncertainty, just
// choices made while turning prose rules into a state machine):
//
// 1. Ownership split: this state machine does NOT own "what's the next item
//    in the queue" — that's the manager's job (it holds the flat item list
//    built from the Session document). Events that need a target item
//    (`play`, `skipToNext`, `skipToPrevious`, the `next` payload of
//    `itemEnded`) carry a `QueueItemRef` supplied by the caller. This keeps
//    the reducer a pure, context-free function of its own inputs.
//
// 2. `.interrupted` doubles as both "actively paused by an interruption/
//    route-loss, awaiting an ended/resume signal" AND "paused-but-ready,
//    not auto-resuming" (05_CORNER_CASES.md #11: "ended without
//    shouldResume -> stay paused but ready; lock screen shows correct
//    state"). Both are representable with `wasPlaying` distinguishing
//    "should auto-resume when told to" from "just sitting there paused."
//
// 3. `.transitioning(from:to:)` models the whole bridge-TTS phase (load +
//    play of the transition_tts item) as one state, rather than routing it
//    back through `.loadingItem`, because bridge assets are presumed
//    predownloaded/local (05_VOICE_AUDIO_SPEC "Everything local before
//    play"), so there's no meaningfully-long "loading" sub-phase worth a
//    separate state value. `itemLoaded` received while `.transitioning`
//    just triggers the playback-start effects; the state itself doesn't
//    change value (it was already "the bridge phase").
//
// 4. Single-player invariant (05_CORNER_CASES.md #19): `.play(item:)`
//    arriving while already `.playing`/`.transitioning` a *different* item
//    is exactly the "two AVPlayers alive" bug shape. The reducer never lets
//    that produce two concurrent "start playback" effects: it forces a
//    `.pausePlayback` before the new `.loadItem`, and always emits
//    `.emitTelemetry` so this is observable in production, not just in
//    tests.
